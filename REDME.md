# PHP Photo Tagger

I'm traveling. If nothing goes wrong, it will take more than half year. During half year, I create huge amount of photos. And on the end of travel, I will barely remember, what and where I have photographed. And it would be hassle to collect certain things, like getting collection of (and only) photos of animals. So, this is, why I have started to writing this app.

## Status

The project consist of disgusting ugly code written in disgusting ugly language. It can tag photos and add them a comment plus list photos by their tag using logic expressions like `(tag1 and not (tag2 or tag3))`.

## How to use?
